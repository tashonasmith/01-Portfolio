                Hello!  My name is Tashona Smith, and I live in Monroe, WI with my husband and our 3 children.  I work as the Operations Manager at Empire Media in Monroe, and am also the co-host of a morning radio segment on 93.7.  I also served as Mrs. Wisconsin International 2018.

            Some of my hobbies include theatre, stand up comedy, singing, playing guitar, photography, and experimenting with fx gore makeup.  I enjoy volunteering and serve as a volunteer board member for the Monroe Theatre Guild and the Literacy Council of Green County, as the Vice President and Secretary respectively.  I love music, some of my favorite groups/artists are Queen, Mumford and Sons, Adele, Hozier, Beyonce, Lizzo, and Kesha.
